# Cleaning# Time Series Analysis Project


## Introduction

In this project, we delve into the fascinating world of time series analysis. What you may have seen in a lecture is just the gist of it. We could go deeper into mathematics and probability, but the main goal is to understand how certain phenomena behave over time:

- **Is the electricity price increasing?** (upward trend)
- **Are we using more water on weekends?** (weekly seasonality)
- **Was there a sudden increase in online purchases during 2020?** (irregularity)
- **How has house purchasing behavior changed over the years?** (cyclicity)
- **How often do you visit the gym each month?** (monthly pattern)
- **What is the daily temperature fluctuation over a year?** (annual seasonality)
- **How frequently do you use your smartphone in a day?** (daily trend)

When you receive a time series, you want to answer some key questions just by looking at the data:

- Can I see some trending or seasonal behavior in my data?
- Can I make an educated guess about the next probable value?
- Does it look like random noise? If it is, let's do some analysis to determine if it's truly noise.
